*Note the line numbers and commentary here refer to the original code, not the code attached that I've changed
Boolean Exp:
	switch statement on line 60: switch (getExpressionCode())
	The code for BooleanExp.AND and BooleanExp.Or are very similar (lines 62-65 and lines 68-71)
	The code for BooleanExp.Const and BooleanExp.Var are very similar (line 74 and line 77)
ExpressionParser:
	High coupling between Boolean Exp and ExpressionParser
	Switch statement in print (both in preorder and inorder sections)
	toString and the preorder are the same, reused code.
