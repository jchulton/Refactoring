Boolean Exp:
	Rep exposure on line 38 (return value.booleanValue())
	Rep exposure on line 41 (return varString)
	switch statement on line 60: switch (getExpressionCode())
	The cases for BooleanExp.AND and BooleanExp.Or are very similar (lines 62-65 and lines 68-71)
	The cases for BooleanExp.Const and BooleanExp.Var are very similar (line 74 and line 77)
ExpressionParser:
	Rep exposure on line 11 (return map.get(var).booleanValue())
High coupling between Boolean Exp and ExpressionParser
